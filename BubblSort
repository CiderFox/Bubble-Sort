!Program: BubbleSort
!%r1    contains the length of array
!%r2    starting address of array ArrayInteger
!%r3    contains indicator (used by outer loop to determine if the prog. should stop(when no swap in iteration)
!r%4    Pointer into array ArrayInteger
!%r5    Holds a near top element (in the inner loop, each iteration will compare 2 elements. The elements to be
!compared and exchanged are tracked by two pointers: %r5 and %r6. %r5 is always above %r6.
!%r6    Holds a near bottom element
